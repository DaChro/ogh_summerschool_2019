Since you are staying in different places, we have just added the locations of those hotels we had made pre-reservations at. We have also added some bus stops for getting from your hotels to GEO 1, along with the reccommended bus connections (click on the bus stops to see them). If you would like to know how to get to GEO 1 from a place that is not in the map, please contact me or use the journey planner mentioned in \"Public Transport\". For clarity, not all layers are active by default. Activate/deactivate them under \"data layers\". Vollbildanzeige Wifi The Wifi is available in most of the University\u00b4s buildings, and since the University is spread all over the city, it is often worthwhile checking for the University SSIDs wherever you are in Muenster. eduroam: If your home institution is part of this initiative, use eduroam, just log in with your usual credentials from home. GuestOnCampus: Any guest can connect to this Wifi without any credentials. After connecting and opening your browser, you will be redirected to the login page.

In addition to these two options, we have applied for accounts with unlimited wifi access for the summer school participants. We will add information about this soon. Dining and Going-Out There are quite a few places to go for a drink or for dinner in Muenster. We do not feel qualified to give recommendations about specific restaurants or bars that fit any given taste, so we have instead marked several streets/quarters on the map below that are great spots to go out at night. These are only a few suggestions, there are many more options throughout the city. Please note that if you stay late and want to ride the bus, there are different schedules and different routes active at night (starting at around 9 PM and marked with a capital \"N\", see also the nighttime route overview ). The journey planner that we have put a link to in \"Public Transport\" accounts for that. Excursion The excursion on Saturday will consist of two parts. First, we will visit the protected area \"Rieselfelder\", a European bird reserve close to Muenster, where we will have a guided tour. Afterwards there will be a lunch break in a nearby restaurant/caf\u00e9. For the second part we will return to Muenster and visit the harbor (yes, Muenster does have a harbor). we will meet at 9:00 AM at the GEO 1 building a bus will take us to the \"Rieselfelder\" after a guided tour we will walk to the restaurant and have a lunch break after the lunch break the bus will pick us up at the restaurant an take us back to Muenster in Muenster there will be a brief guided tour in the harbour we expect finish at around 4:00 PM afterwards you are free to join us to explore some of the many events during the cultural festival \"Schauraum\" (see below) and have a drink or two \"Schauraum M\u00fcnster\" From Sep 5 to Sep 7, there is a festival of museums and galleries in Muenster, called \"Schauraum\" (show room) ( see here ) This is one reason why Muenster will be even more crowded than usual and why it was so difficult to find available hotels, etc. but it is also a nice option to visit after the summer school. On Saturday, museums and galleries throughout Muenster will be open and free of charge until midnight! Weather Muenster is somewhat famous for its bad weather. This does not mean that it is always raining (in fact this summer has so far mostly been very warm and sunny) but chances of rain are quite high so it is a good idea tp prepare for that.
