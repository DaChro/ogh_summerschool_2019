In this document you will find general information and tips for your stay in Muenster. It will be updated and extended continuously as the summer school approaches. Make sure to check this page again shortly before your trip. Venue The Institute for Geoinformatics is located in the GEO 1 building at Heisenbergstra\u00dfe 2 in the Northwest of Muenster where it resides together with the Institutes of Landscape Ecology, Geography, and Didactics of Geography. GEO 1 will also be the venue of this year's summer school. The plenaries/lectures will be held in the main lecture hall, which you will find on the ground floor directly next to the main entrance. The parallel sessions will be held in three seminar rooms located on the second (242), third (323) and fourth floor (401). We will make sure to hang up enough signs so that you can easily find every room. In addition, you can use the GEO 1 information system (located next to the lecture hall) that will give you turn-by-turn directions to any room, person or institute. Coffee breaks and lunches will be in the atrium on the ground floor. Public Transport You will receive free bus tickets valid throughout the week of the summer school. You can use these tickets in all buses in Muenster. In the map below we have inserted some bus stops you can use for getting from your hotels to GEO1 and back.

Wifi The Wifi of the University of Muenster is available in most of the University\u00b4s buildings, and since the University is spread all over the city, it is often worthwhile checking for the University SSIDs wherever you are in Muenster. eduroam: If your home institution is part of this initiative, use eduroam, just log in with your usual credentials. GuestOnCampus: Any guest can connect to this Wifi without any credentials. After connecting and opening your browser, you will be redirected to the login page. Please note, that the data volume is restricted to 1 GB per day and the connection is not encrypted. Dining and Going-Out If in one evening you find yourselves not sated by R and drunk with Python there are quite a few places to go for a drink or for dinner in Muenster. We do not feel qualified to give recommendations about specific restaurants or bars that fit any given taste, so we have instead marked several streets/quarters on the map below that are great spots to go out at night. Please note that if you stay late and want to ride the bus, there are different schedules and different routes active at night (starting at around 9 PM and marked with a capital \"N\", see also the nighttime route overview ). The journey planner that we have put a link to in \"Public Transport\" accounts for that. Excursion The excursion on Saturday will consist of two parts. First, we will visit the protected area \"Rieselfelder\", a European bird reserve close to Muenster, where we will have a guided tour. Afterwards there will be a lunch break in a nearby restaurant/caf\u00e9. For the second part we will return to Muenster and .... - we will meet at 9:00 AM at the GEO 1 building - a bus will take us to the \"Rieselfelder\" where we will have the guided tour - after the tour we will walk to the restaurant and have a lunch break - after the lunch break the bus will pick us up at the restaurant an take us back to Muenster - in Muenster there will be the ... tour - we expect finish at around ... - afterwards you are free to join us to explore some of the many events during the cultural festival \"Schauraum\" and have a drink or two if you still have time \"Schauraum M\u00fcnster\" From Sep 5 to Sep 7 there is a festival of museums and galleries in Muenster ( see here ) This is the reason why Muenster will be full and why it was so difficult to find available hotels, tours etc. but it is also a nice option to visit after the summer school. On Saturday, museums and galleries throughout Muenster will be open and free of charge until midnight! Weather Muenster is somewhat famous for its bad weather. This does not mean that it is always raining (in fact this summer has so far mostly been very warm and sunny) but chances of rain are quite high so you should be prepared for that.
