In this document you will find general information and tips for your stay in Muenster. It will be updated and extended continuously as the summer school approaches. Venue The Institute for Geoinformatics is located in the GEO 1 building at Heisenbergstra\u00dfe 2 in the Northwest of Muenster where it resides together with the Institutes of Landscape Ecology, Geography, and Didactics of Geography. GEO 1 will also be the venue of this year's summer school. The plenaries/lectures will be held in the main lecture hall, which you will find on the ground floor directly next to the main entrance. The parallel sessions will be held in three seminar rooms located on the second (242), third (323) and fourth floor (401). We will make sure to hang up enough signs so that you can easily find every room. In addition, you can use the GEO 1 information system (located next to the lecture hall) that will give you turn-by-turn directions to any room, person or institute. Coffee breaks and lunches will be in the atrium on the ground floor. Public Transport You will receive free bus tickets valid throughout the week of the summer school. You can use these tickets in all buses in Muenster. In the map below we have inserted some bus stops you can use for getting from your hotels to GEO1 and back.

Dining and Going-Out If in one evening you find yourselves not sated by R and drunk with Python there are quite a few places to go for a drink or for dinner in Muenster. We do not feel qualified to give recommendations about specific restaurants or bars that fit any given taste, so we have instead marked several streets/quarters on the map below that are great spots to go out at night. Please note that if you stay late and want to ride the bus, there are different schedules and different routes active at night (starting at around 9 PM and marked with a capital \"N\", see also the nighttime route overview ). The journey planner that we have put a link to in \"Public Transport\" accounts for that. Excursion The excursion on Saturday will consist of two parts. First, we will visit the protected area \"Rieselfelder\", a European bird reserve close to Muenster, where we will have a guided tour.

This does not mean that it is always raining (in fact this summer has so far mostly been very warm and sunny) but chances of rain are quite high so you should be prepared for that. Map This map contains some hotels and important points of interest to assist you in orientating. Since you are staying in different places, we have just added the locations of those hotels we had made pre-reservations at, along with the corresponding bus stops and directions to get to GEO 1.
